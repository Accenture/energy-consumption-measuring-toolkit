#### Generate Graph to benchmark the Energy Consumed by Software Appliation vs Time Taken for python applications.

The Matplotlib module has a method for drawing scatter plots, it needs two arrays of the same length, one for the values of the x-axis, and one for the values of the y-axis:

Parameters:

x_axis_data: Energy Consumed in Joules by Software Applications.
y_axis_data: Total execution time of Software Application.
